# hashmap
a light-weight cryptographically signed key value store inspired by IPNS

This is a very early and incomplete prototype of the hashMap server. Currently the DB is in-memory only and is deleted between runs. This code needs test coverage and possibly some rethinking on some of the structures, but this is working as an MVP.

While in development, the easiest way to run the `hashmap` CLI tool is to run

```
./scripts/build.sh
```
